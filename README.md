# Breast Cancer Prediction
Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Objective:
- To study the dataset available on breast cancer and predict the results to use it for predictions.
- To do an exploratory data analysis on the data
- Create an ML-model & do a comparative analysis of all the models to conclude to our best ML-model for prediction of breast cancer
- Use Microsoft Azure Services to deploy the machine learning model
